Iâ€™m a builder exploring where **AI, psychology, and creativity** meet.  
Iâ€™m building **ClipFinder** from scratch â€” an AI-powered tool designed to make discovering and sharing short, meaningful content effortless.  
This project is my way of exploring how generative AI can simplify search, boost creativity, and connect people through smarter discovery.

### Focus & Tech
- **Python**
- **Generative AI integration**: prompt engineering, fine-tuning LLMs, Hugging Face / OpenAI APIs  
- **AI apps**: chatbots, content & image generation  
- **Ethical deployment** by design

What shapes my work: **football, psychology, and storytelling** â€” I aim for products that feel meaningful, not just functional.
