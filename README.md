# Hi, I'm Abiral 👋  

I’m a builder at heart, exploring the space where **AI, psychology, and creativity** intersect.  
Currently, I’m developing **ClipFinder** from scratch — the first of many projects where I aim to turn abstract ideas into practical tools.  

I specialize in **generative AI integration**:  
- Prompt Engineering & Fine-tuning LLMs  
- Hugging Face / OpenAI APIs  
- AI-powered applications (chatbots, content creation, image generation)  
- Ethical AI deployment  

Beyond code, I find meaning in **football, psychology, and storytelling** — shaping how I design and create.
